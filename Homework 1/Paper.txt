GUI is a type of interface essentially for visualizing the contents of a device/program. GUIs are much simpler and easier for 
the average person to use than command line, but it doesn't give you full access to the device and limits what you're able to
do with it. The CLI functions largely in the same way, but entirely through a bare text interface. It's like staring directly 
into the bare guts of the computer and being able to manipulate them by hand instead of having select parts filtered through 
the GUI. It's a lot more open-ended, but also much more complicated to learn and you'll run a slightly higher risk of making 
mistakes that permanently mess up your device if you don't know what you're doing.
